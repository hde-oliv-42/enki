## How it works:
On an instance, you can send a GET method on the main route to receive a JSON containing curated information about a École 42 student.  
To see all the routes, read the [wiki section](https://github.com/42sp/42labs-selection-process-hde-oliv/wiki/Endpoints) about it.

## How to instantiate it:
You can read the [wiki section](https://github.com/42sp/42labs-selection-process-hde-oliv/wiki/How-to-host-it) on how to instantiate it.

## It is extensible!
You can implement more routes easily, read the [wiki section](https://github.com/42sp/42labs-selection-process-hde-oliv/wiki/How-to-expand-it) for details.

## And you can test it now!
The latest version is already hosted on Heroku, you can access it on: https://enki-api.herokuapp.com/
